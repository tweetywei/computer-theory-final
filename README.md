# computer-theory-final
This is the final project of the Computer Theory course in CSIE. We implement the AI for the Chinese Dark Chess and the lecturers hold a AI Chinese Dark Chess competitions in the course :) The interfaces of the chesses and the sample codes are provided by the TA. We're in charge of the strategies itself (mainly in final/sample_code/Custom/CDC_AI.cpp.)
